# Alternative Deployment Options for Full Python Support

Since Vercel doesn't natively support Python runtime for serverless functions, here are alternative deployment strategies:

## Option 1: Hybrid Deployment (Recommended)

### Frontend on Vercel
Deploy the Flutter web app on Vercel for its excellent CDN and hosting.

### Backend on Railway/Render
Deploy the Python service separately on a platform that supports Python:

#### Railway Deployment
1. Create account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project
3. Deploy Python service:
   ```bash
   cd python_service
   railway init
   railway up
   ```
4. Get the deployment URL
5. Update Flutter app to use Railway URL

#### Render Deployment
1. Create account at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create new Web Service
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `python hand_detection_service.py`
5. Get the deployment URL
6. Update Flutter app to use Render URL

## Option 2: Netlify with Functions

Netlify supports Python functions better than Vercel:

1. Install Netlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Create `netlify.toml`:
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "flutter/bin/flutter build web --release"
     publish = "build/web"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200

   [functions]
     directory = "netlify/functions"
   ```

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Option 3: Google Cloud Run

For production-grade deployment with full Python support:

1. Create `Dockerfile`:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY python_service/ .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   CMD ["python", "hand_detection_service.py"]
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy dell-photobooth \
     --source . \
     --region us-central1 \
     --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

## Option 4: Use Third-Party APIs

Replace local Python processing with API services:

### For Palm Detection
- Use Google's MediaPipe JavaScript SDK (client-side)
- Already partially implemented in your app

### For Background Removal
- **remove.bg API**: Professional background removal
  ```dart
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('https://api.remove.bg/v1.0/removebg'),
    headers: {
      'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    },
    body: {'image_file_b64': base64Image},
  );
  ```

- **Clipdrop API**: Background removal and editing
- **PhotoRoom API**: Professional photo editing

## Option 5: AWS Lambda

Deploy Python functions as AWS Lambda:

1. Package Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -t package/ -r requirements.txt
   cd package
   zip -r ../function.zip .
   cd ..
   zip -g function.zip lambda_function.py
   ```

2. Deploy via AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws lambda create-function \
     --function-name dell-photobooth \
     --runtime python3.9 \
     --handler lambda_function.handler \
     --zip-file fileb://function.zip
   ```

3. Create API Gateway to expose Lambda

## Recommended Approach

For your use case, I recommend:

1. **Keep Flutter on Vercel** - It's working well
2. **Deploy Python service on Railway/Render** - Easy and supports Python
3. **Update environment service** to use the Python service URL:

```dart
class EnvironmentService {
  static String get apiBaseUrl {
    if (kDebugMode || _isLocalhost()) {
      return 'http://localhost:5555';
    }
    // Your Railway/Render URL
    return 'https://dell-photobooth.up.railway.app';
  }
}
```

## Quick Start with Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Deploy Python service
cd python_service
railway init
railway up

# Get URL
railway open
```

This gives you full Python support with minimal changes to your codebase!
